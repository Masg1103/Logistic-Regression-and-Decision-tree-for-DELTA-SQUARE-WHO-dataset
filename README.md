# Logistic-Regression-and-Decision-tree-for-DELTA-SQUARE-WHO-dataset

### **DELTASQUARE / WHO**
DeltaSquare, an NGO collaborating with the Government on social policy issues, aims to positively impact the lives of underprivileged communities. Their current objective involves formulating a policy framework based on data obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO). As a data scientist employed by DeltaSquare, you have been assigned the responsibility of addressing this challenge and presenting a proposal to the government.

### **Objective:**
The objective of the dataset is to explore and address the following primary inquiries:

What are the various factors that impact an individual's income?
Does a reliable predictive model for income exist, and if so, how can its performance be assessed?

### **Goal**
My goal for this project is to a model with minimized errors in the class i am most interested in. I am interested in finding those who earn above 50K. Hence my model should have a high positive in that class and minimal error (Recall_score).

It should be noted that this will increase the predicted number (the error) of those who earn 50K or less as rather people who earn above 50k
